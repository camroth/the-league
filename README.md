#The League - Constitution

1. This is the constitution of the 'The League' Fantasy Football League.
1. The League consists of 16 owners.
	* Erica Conrad
	* Shane Doucette
	* Shane Giroux
	* Richard Gryschuk
	* Shawn Gryschuk
	* Josh Hewison
	* Matt Horning
	* Romeo Iula
	* Albert Jame
	* Michael Klein
	* Tyler Marien
	* David Molesky
	* Amy Prokop
	* Clayton Richard
	* Cameron Roth
	* Arlin Schaffel

1. The League consists of 3 commissioners, of which will maintain a majority-rules system of determining changes:
	* Shawn Gryschuk
	* David Molesky
	* Cameron Roth

1. In the event that a league owner leaves, a replacement owner will be found to take over the abandoned team. If an even number of owners leave, a vote will be held by the remaining owners in The League to determine if we should reduce the number of owners. 1 roster spot will be added for each reduction of 2 owners. If there is a reduction in owners, The League may vote on changing the number of teams that make the playoffs.

1. Each team will have 21 players on its roster, coming from the pool of any draftable player as determined by Yahoo!, plus two available Injured Reserve spots.
 
1. Every year, The League will hold its annual rookie draft. To accommodate this, benches will be expanded by 6 spots prior to the draft. Once the benches have been expanded, no free agents will be allowed to be picked up (but may be drafted in the annual draft). The draft will be held, as voted in agreeance, after the annual NFL Draft but before the beginning of the NFL preseason. 4 weeks after The League's draft, benches will be reduced by 6 spots. If your roster does not have 6 empty spots, players will be removed by the commissioners, starting with the ones added most recently, and put back into the free agency pool.

	The draft order is different each year and is determined by 2 parameters:
	* For the 8 teams that make the playoffs, they will receive the 9th-16th picks, based on the reverse order of the final standings.
	* The 8 teams that did not make the playoffs will be seeded in order of their total points **had they played their optimal lineup in each week of the season** up to the conclusion of week 13. This is to prevent the possibility of tanking for the number one pick the following year. The League does not consider results of the consolation bracket to determine the draft order for the teams that do not make the playoffs.

1. Being a dynasty league, each player on your roster at the conclusion of the season will be there for the start of the next season. If you wish to not keep a player, simply drop them from your roster prior to the playoffs starting or after the playoffs conclude.
 
1. Each team can make any trade they want up until the day before the first game of Week 11. After the trade deadline, no trades will be allowed during the remainder of the NFL regular season. 

	Each team may drop a player from their roster at any time and replace him with any player who is not on another teamâ€™s roster. This process follows the Yahoo! waiver rules.

	After the NFL regular season is complete, waivers are no longer open, but trading of players can resume and free agents can be picked up.

1. Each team shall set its starting lineup each week. A starting lineup consists of one quarterback, one running back, two wide receivers, one tight end, one kicker, one team defense and two additional flex player who may be either a running back or a wide receiver or a tight end. **If you fail to fill all positions in your lineup for 3 weeks in a season, you will not be invited back the following season.** If you are unable to set your lineup, but would like changes made, let a commissioner know before kickoff of the players you would like subbed in. **In the event a commissioner fails to sub the player in, but proof (email or text message timestamp) exists of your reaching out, that will be accepted over the points recorded for the match.**

	The league uses standard Yahoo! scoring, with the addition of:
	* 0.5 points per reception for QBs, RBs, WRs and TEs (0.5)
	* 6 points for all touchdowns (6)
	* QB INTs are worth -2 (-2)
	* Kicker's gain 1 point for a missed FG of 50+ yards (+1)
	* Kicker's lose 3 points for missing a PAT (-3)
	* DSTs gain 2 points for a sack (2)
	* DSTs gain 15 points for allowing < 0 yards (15)
	* DSTs gain 10 points for allowing < 100 yards
	* DSTs gain 8 points for allowing < 200 yards
	* DSTs gain 6 points for allowing < 300 yards
	* DSTs gain 4 points for allowing < 400 yards
	* DSTs gain 2 points for allowing < 500 yards

	Each team plays one game per week as listed in the schedule on the league website. Each week, the team with more points than its opponent gets a win. If two teams tie during a regular season matchup, it remains a tie.
 
1. The playoffs will take place from Week 14 through Week 16 of the NFL season. The top team in each division (of which there are 4) will be granted a playoff spot, and the remaining four openings will be seeded to the remaining teams with the best records. If two teams have the same record entering the playoffs, Total Points For will break the tie. If two teams are still tied, head-to-head record and Total Points Against will be used as further tie breakers, in that order.

1. Any changes to the League Constitution will be discussed amongst the members of the League, and put to vote before changes are ratified. All changes will occur during the offseason, unless there is a small change needed to clarify an existing rule.

1. All issues to be voted on will have each owner cast one vote. In the event of a tie, the side with more commissioner votes will be deemed to have won. Votes will last one week (or shorter if the vote is time-sensitive).

1. The commissioners retain the right to reverse any transactions or actions that cause The League to become unfair for all participants.
